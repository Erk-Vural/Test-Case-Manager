            -'save' and 'save and add another' buttons needs to redirect.   !!

  Design Bugs:

        - 'list releases'' s size is wrong.                                 ++

        - navbar links (issue,case) doesnt work cuz they cant get the id.   ++


** Improvements
    - remove 'save and add another' button.                                 ++
    - reformat app.                                                         ++
    - view's for loops are wrong needs to replaced with 'filter'.           ++
    - view's need to seperated.                                             ++
    - Issue and Release form needs formatting.(Form formatting django).     ++
        Used cripsy forms for styling Release and Issue.

    - Merge test to setup and contiune work from test for case redesign.    ++

--Case Redesign---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    # Url -> created a new url path for view.

    # Template -> Templates need a full redesign.
        - First it needs to differ an empty case from a updatable case.
        - If it is a new case call then empty form should create and save.
        - If we clicked on a issue new case_manage should list all related
        case info in a single excel like page.
        - All cases should be editable from there (with save, delete buttons).

    # View ->
        - View needs to both create and save an form.
        - It also needs to take all related cases and send it to template.
        * Last bug was, can't identify case and form relationship in
        templates.Creating a struct or class might fix the issue.

    ** Objectives:
    - Seperate all logic to services.
        - release ++
        - issue   ++
        - case    ++

    - All cases should be editable and deletable separtely.
                - release ++
                - issue   ++
                - case    ++
    * ToDo:
            - Create new case:
                - Create button directs to case/new.                        ++
                - Save button saves new case.                               ++
                - Needs grid formatting                                     ++

            - Case manage:
                - Need to list case forms.                                  ++
                - Need to add infos to form values.                         ++
                - Needs grid formatting                                     ++

                - delete button should work for each case                   ++
                    (Add case.id to form to get id for delete.)

                - Status need to be a dropdown with 5 choices               ++
                    - Todo - OK -NotOk - Review - In Progress

                 - Save need a redesign                                     ++
                    - Whenever we change something it needs to save.
                    - Focus or upkey event of JQuery might work.
                        - keyup work every time event is triggered
                        - Focusout worked
                            - save-form->needs to save that case everytime
                            - empty-form->needs to save a new form and add
                                a new form.


                - start test number by 1 and auto increment.                    ++

                - Every time there should be a extra case for                   ++
                adding new case and if it filled then a new one should add.


--Tests & Bugfix & Improvements------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    *Bugs:
        - datepickers doesn't work.(might be something caused by crispy forms.) ++
        - release edit wont work                                                ++
        - reformat 'release' and 'issue'                                        ++
        - save_form doesnt edit it adds a new release.                          ++
        - fill form needs editting                                              ++

        - release_delete got multiple values for id                             ++
            (url got service func name instead of view)
        - buttons won work fully clickable(remove button tags from templates)   ++
        - if case empty it doesnt opens a new case                              ++
        - case create button at case manage doesnt work(URL was wrong)          ++
        - Issue service,view got a naming error.                                ++
        - Service imports and function names need reformatting.                 ++

        - release_delete() got multiple values for argument 'pk'                ++
        - issue_delete() got multiple values for argument 'pk'                  ++
        - case_delete() got multiple values for argument 'pk'                   ++
            (View delete's doesn't had a request parameter but needed it.)      ++
        - Reverse for 'case_delete' with arguments '('',)' not found.           ++
            1 pattern(s) tried: ['case/delete/(?P<pk>[0-9]+)/$']
            (it doesnt work now because it missing case.id)
        - case delete redirect to case list not case manage.                    ++
        - case new saves new case but doesnt redirect to case_manage            ++
            (redirect view and send issue.id to view)
        - test_number needs to auto increment                                   ++
            (we can remove it from model and work only on template.)


        - save case overrides other cases.
        - only some fields are saved in save case(2-3 texboxes usually.)
        - Status choicefield wont work right
        - delete field value wont work.
        - cases could save by cases not fields
        - CaseForm obj_id is none
            (probably cuz by obj_id is not on IU to initialize)

        - remove case manage button from issue_list                             ++

    *Improvements:
        ! Need to Research rest api.For the views to have a better structure.
